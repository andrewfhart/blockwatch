Blockwatch is a user interface to the DataFluency Blockwatch API. It offers fast, interactive, and near-realtime visualizations and statistics of the Bitcoin blockchain.

The front-end is implemented as an [AngularJS] web application.

The DataFluency [Blockwatch API](https://github.com/andrewfhart/blockwatch-api), a [NodeJS] web service backed by [LevelDB], provides most of the raw source data.
